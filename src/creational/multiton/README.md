Multiton Pattern
================

The multiton pattern is a design pattern similar to the singleton, which allows only one instance of a class to be created. The multiton pattern expands on the singleton concept to manage a map of named instances as key-value pairs. Rather than having a single instance per application, the multiton pattern instead ensures a single instance per key.
