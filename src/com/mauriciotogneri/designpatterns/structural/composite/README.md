Composite Pattern
=================

The composite pattern is a design pattern which describes that a group of objects have to be treated in the same way as a single instance of an object. The intent of a composite is to **compose** objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Implementing the composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
