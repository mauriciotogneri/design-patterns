Memento Pattern
===============

The memento pattern is a design pattern which provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (undo via rollback). The pattern is implemented with three objects: the originator, the caretaker and the memento. The originator is some object that has an internal state. The caretaker is going to do something to the originator, but wants to be able to undo the change. The caretaker first asks the originator for a memento object. Then it performs the operation it was going to do. To rollback to the state before the operations, it returns the memento object to the originator. The memento object itself is an opaque object (one which the caretaker cannot, or should not, change). When using this pattern, care should be taken if the originator may change other objects or resources because the memento pattern operates on a single object.
