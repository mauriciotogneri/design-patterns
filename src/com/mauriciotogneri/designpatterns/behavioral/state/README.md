State Pattern
=============

The state pattern is a degisn patter which allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It encapsulates varying behavior for the same routine based on an object's state object. This can be a cleaner way for an object to change its behavior at runtime without resorting to large monolithic conditional statements.
