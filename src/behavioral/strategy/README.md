Strategy Pattern
================

The strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a design pattern which enables an algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime. The pattern:

* Defines a family of algorithms
* Encapsulates each algorithm
* Makes the algorithms interchangeable within that family

The pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
