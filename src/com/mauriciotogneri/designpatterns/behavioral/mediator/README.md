Mediator Pattern
================

The mediator pattern is a design pattern which defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Objects no longer communicate directly with each other, but instead communicate through the mediator. The pattern promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets the programmer vary their interaction independently.
