Observer Pattern
================

The observer pattern (also known as publish–subscribe pattern) is a design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. It defines a one-to-many dependency between objects where a state change in one object results in all its dependents being notified.
