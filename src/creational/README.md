Creational Patterns
===================

Creational patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

The creational patterns aim to separate a system from how its objects are created, composed, and represented. They increase the system's flexibility in terms of the what, who, how, and when of object creation.

Creational patterns are composed of two dominant ideas:

* Encapsulate knowledge about which concrete classes the system uses
* Hide how instances of these concrete classes are created and combined
