Adapter or Translator Pattern
=============================

The adapter pattern is a design pattern which allows the interface of an existing class to be used from another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code. The adapter design pattern is used when you want two different classes with incompatible interfaces to work together.

Interfaces may be incompatible but the inner functionality should suit the need. The Adapter pattern allows otherwise incompatible classes to work together by converting the interface of one class into an interface expected by the clients.
