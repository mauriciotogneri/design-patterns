Factory Method Pattern
======================

The factory method pattern is a design pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. This is done by creating objects via a factory method, which is either specified in an interface (abstract class) and implemented in implementing classes (concrete classes); or implemented in a base class (optionally as a template method), which can be overridden when inherited in derived classes; rather than by a constructor.
