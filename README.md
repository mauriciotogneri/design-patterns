Design Patterns
===============

This repository aims to present an example of each design pattern using **Java**. A design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context. A design pattern is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.
