Module Pattern
==============

The module pattern is a design pattern which is used to implement the concept of software modules, defined by modular programming, in a programming language that does not or only partially supports it. There are several ways to implement this pattern, depending on the host programming language, such as the singleton design pattern, object-oriented static members in a class, and procedural global functions.
