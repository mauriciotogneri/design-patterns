Flyweight Pattern
=================

The flyweight pattern is a design pattern which allows minimizing memory use by sharing as much data as possible between similar objects. It is a way to use objects in large numbers when a simple repeated representation would use an unacceptable amount of memory. Often some parts of the object state can be shared, and it is common practice to hold them in external data structures and pass them to the flyweight objects temporarily when they are used.
