Double-Checked Locking Pattern
==============================

The double-checked locking pattern is a design pattern which is used to reduce the overhead of acquiring a lock by first testing the locking criterion without actually acquiring the lock. Only if the locking criterion check indicates that locking is required does the actual locking logic proceed. It is typically used to reduce locking overhead when implementing "lazy initialization" in a multi-threaded environment, especially as part of the Singleton pattern. Lazy initialization avoids initializing a value until the first time it is accessed.
