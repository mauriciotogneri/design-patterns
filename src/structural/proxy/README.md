Proxy Pattern
=============

The proxy pattern is a design patter which provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. A proxy, in its most general form, is a class functioning as an interface to something else. The proxy could interface to anything: a network connection, a large object in memory, a file, or some other resource that is expensive or impossible to duplicate.
